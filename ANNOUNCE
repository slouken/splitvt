Announcing the newest version of splitvt!

SECURITY ALERT!!!

	splitvt versions lower than 1.6.4 are known to have a
security hole allowing a user to gain ROOT access on some systems!

	If you have a version lower than 1.6.4 _please_ remove
the set-uid bit on your current version, and upgrade to the newer
version as soon as possible.
("splitvt -version" will tell you what version you are running)

The set-uid bit is only for updating the utmp database and for
changing ownership of its pseudo-terminals.  It is not necessary
for splitvt's operation.

The latest version is available via the web at:
	http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/projects/splitvt/


What it is:

	Splitvt is a program that splits any vt100 compatible 
screen into two - an upper and lower window in which you can run
two programs at the same time.  Splitvt differs from screen in 
that while screen gives you multiple virtual screens, splitvt splits
your screen into two fully visible windows.  You can even use 
splitvt with screen to provide multiple split screens.  This can 
be very handy when running over a modem, or for developing
client-server applications or watching routine tasks as you work.

	If you are using splitvt in a new and unusual way,
I'd like to hear about it!

What's new?

Here is the list of things from the CHANGES file:

        Version 1.6.4
                                Placed under the GNU General Public License
                                Fixed scroll region reset on exit
                                Fixed a comparison of unsigned char with EOF
                                Patched some security holes:
                                        fixed buffer overflow in lock.c
                                Added "make install" target (/usr/local/bin)

----

What's planned?

	I want to beef up the startup file syntax so that you can
specify the format of the "status bar", or window divider, and I plan
to rewrite the startup file parser so that it allows you to use more
flexible and powerful startup scripts.  I am also toying with the idea
of cut-paste "screen" style, and a window history that you can scroll
back through.  I have cut-paste partially working.
Other things on the pot are cleaning up dead windows, dynamically starting
new windows, etc...
	If you have any wishes, just let me know at slouken@cs.ucdavis.edu,
and I'll try to include them in future releases of splitvt.  I'll try to 
avoid feeping creaturism, but a few bells and whistles would be nice. :)

Note: At the moment I have several other projects, and have this one on
      unspecified hold.  This release was mainly to fix some security holes.

Will it run on my system?

	Well, if you run a UNIX that has pseudo-tty support, 
chances are that splitvt will work on your system.  Splitvt has
been ported to all of the "standard" unices, and also to a few
oddball unices, such as AIX, NewsOS, MP-RAS, and NeXT.

Well, that about wraps it up.  I hope you enjoy this software,
originally conceived by Dave Ljung and created by yours truly.


Enjoy!
